  <p> The purpose of the following task is to determine how people learn about quantities that change over time</p>

  <p> In the following screens, you will try to understand how certain quantities change over time using plots. Each plot will display a number of points indicating how the quantity changes over time, moving from left to right. Some of the points on each plot will be missing, indicating that the value of the quantity at that time is unknown. On each trial one of these missing points will appear on the plot. Your goal will be to correctly indicate whether or not that point is consistent with the visible points on the plot.

  <p> On each trial a blue point will appear on the plot. Pressing the "s" key will indicate that you think this point is consistent with the other points visible on the plot. Pressing the "a" key will indicate that you think this point is <b>NOT</b> consistent with the other points visible on the plot

  <p> You will complete this task for 10 plots in total. For each plot, you will make a total of 33 judgments.</p>
