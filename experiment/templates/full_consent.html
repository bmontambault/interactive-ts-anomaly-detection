You are invited to participate in a study conducted by the Visual Analytics Lab at
Tufts University. Please read the following carefully before deciding to participate.
You may participate in this study if you are between the ages of 18 and 65 and are
comfortable communicating in English. We expect the entire study to take about 15
minutes maximum, but you will be allotted 60 minutes to complete the study. Your
participation in the study is completely voluntary. If you choose to participate in the
study you are free to revoke your consent and terminate the study at any time

There are no direct benefits or forseeable risks to you for participating in this study.
However, if you decide to take part, you will play an integral role in the development
of future visualizations. Any information collected in this study will be entirely
confidential. The questionnaire that you would be required to complete will only be
identifiable by an assigned ID number, and will not be associated with your name or
any personally identifiable information.

<h4>Purpose of the Study</h4>
We aim to better understand how people make judgements based on visualizations.
The result of this study would help in the improvement of future visualization
designs.

<h4>Task Description</h4>
You will be shown several visualizations and asked to make judgements based on
them. Please try to respond as accurately as possible. Afterwards, you will be asked
to complete a demographic questionnaire and provide any additional feedback you
wish.
<br>

You will be paid a base price of $2.00 and an additional $1.00 if your responses are
above an accuracy threshold. Total possible compensation will be $3.00.
